Dictionary Implementation

An implementation of a general dictionary that allows efficient insertions, 
deletions and access to a collection of objects. Here, efficient refers to 
O(lg n) time or better.

I implement a *red-black tree*:
A redâ€“black tree is a binary search tree with an extra bit of data per node, 
its color, which can be either red or black. The extra bit of storage ensures 
an approximately balanced tree by constraining how nodes are colored from any 
path from the root to the leaf. Thus, it is a data structure which is a type 
of self-balancing binary search tree.
