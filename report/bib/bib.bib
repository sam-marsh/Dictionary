abstract = "A new data structure called the q-fast trie is introduced. Given a set of N records whose keys are distinct nonnegative integers less than some initially specified bound M, a q-fast trie uses space O(N) and time O(√log M) for insertions, deletions, and all the retrieval operations commonly associated with binary trees. A simpler but less space efficient data structure called the p-fast trie is defined. "

Here n denotes the number of elements stored in the dictionary and N denotes the size of the universe. Previously, this time bound required O(N) space. "
